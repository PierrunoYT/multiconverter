# Privacy Policy

**Last updated: June 2025**

## Our Commitment to Privacy

MultiConverter is designed with privacy as a core principle. We believe your files and data should remain completely private and under your control.

> **Current Status**: Following recent project cleanup and stability improvements, our privacy-first approach remains unchanged. All file processing continues to happen locally in your browser with no data collection or tracking.

## 🔒 How We Protect Your Privacy

### No Data Collection
- **We don't collect any personal information**
- **We don't track your usage**
- **We don't use analytics or tracking scripts**
- **We don't store cookies for tracking purposes**

### Local Processing Only
- **All file conversions happen in your browser**
- **Your files never leave your device**
- **No uploads to our servers**
- **No cloud processing**

### No Data Storage
- **We don't store your files**
- **We don't keep conversion history**
- **Temporary files are automatically cleared**
- **No data persists after you close the browser**

## 🛡️ Technical Implementation

### Client-Side Processing
MultiConverter uses modern web technologies to process files entirely in your browser:

- **File API**: For reading uploaded files
- **Canvas API**: For image processing
- **Web Workers**: For heavy processing without blocking the UI
- **Local Storage**: Only for user preferences (theme, settings)

### No Network Requests
Once the application loads:
- **No files are transmitted over the network**
- **No conversion data is sent to external services**
- **No third-party APIs are used for file processing**
